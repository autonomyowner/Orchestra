## 🤖 Model Selection Strategy

### Automatic Model Selection
Your system automatically chooses the best model for each task:

- **Architecture Agent**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (best for planning)
- **Frontend Agent**: GPT-4 Omni (excellent for React/Next.js)
- **Backend Agent**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (great for APIs)
- **Database Agent**: GPT-4 Omni (good for SQL/Prisma)
- **Deployment Agent**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (best for DevOps)
- **Quality Agent**: GPT-4 Omni (great for testing)

### Cost Optimization Features
- **Simple tasks** automatically use cheaper models
- **Fallback system** prevents failed requests
- **Real-time cost tracking** during builds
- **Model-specific task optimization**

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```env
# OpenRouter API Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openrouter-api-key-here
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1

# Model Selection
ARCHITECT_MODEL=anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet
FRONTEND_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o
BACKEND_MODEL=anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet
DATABASE_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o
DEPLOYMENT_MODEL=anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet
QUALITY_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o

# Fallback Models
FALLBACK_MODELS=openai/gpt-4o,anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet,google/gemini-pro

# Cost Optimization
MAX_TOKENS_PER_REQUEST=4000
ENABLE_COST_OPTIMIZATION=true
USE_CHEAPER_MODELS_FOR_SIMPLE_TASKS=true
```

### Custom Model Configuration
You can customize which models are used for specific tasks:

```python
# In your project_builder.py
from core.openrouter_client import OpenRouterClient

client = OpenRouterClient()

# Use specific model for a task
response, model, cost = await client.generate_with_fallback(
    prompt="Your prompt here",
    task_type="architecture",  # or "frontend", "backend", etc.
    complexity="medium"  # "simple", "medium", "complex"
)
```

## 📊 Cost Tracking

### Real-time Monitoring
During project builds, you'll see:
```
🤖 Using model: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Attempt 1)
✅ Success! Cost: $0.0123, Tokens: 4100, Time: 2.34s
```

### Cost Summary

## 🔄 Fallback System

### How It Works
1. **Primary Model**: System tries the optimal model for the task
2. **Automatic Fallback**: If primary fails, tries alternative models
3. **Cost Optimization**: Uses cheaper models for simple tasks
4. **Reliability**: Ensures your builds never fail due to model issues

### Fallback Chain
```
Architecture Task:
1. Claude 3.5 Sonnet (primary)
2. GPT-4 Omni (fallback 1)
3. Gemini Pro (fallback 2)

Frontend Task:
1. GPT-4 Omni (primary)
2. Claude 3.5 Sonnet (fallback 1)
3. Gemini Pro (fallback 2)
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"API key not found"**
```bash
# Solution: Run setup script
python setup_openrouter.py
```

**"Connection failed"**
```bash
# Check your internet connection
# Verify API key is correct
# Ensure you have credits in your OpenRouter account
```

**"Model not available"**
```bash
# The system will automatically fallback to alternative models
# Check OpenRouter status page for model availability
```

### Performance Tips

1. **Add Credits**: Keep $10-50 in your account for smooth operation
2. **Monitor Costs**: Use the cost summary to track spending
3. **Optimize Prompts**: Clear, specific prompts use fewer tokens
4. **Use Simple Tasks**: For basic operations, let the system use cheaper models

## 🎯 Advanced Features

### Custom Model Mapping
```python
# Override default model selection
client.task_model_mapping["custom_task"] = "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet"
```

### Cost Limits
```python
# Set maximum cost per request
os.environ["MAX_TOKENS_PER_REQUEST"] = "2000"
```

### Model Preferences
```python
# Prioritize specific models
client.fallback_models = ["anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet", "openai/gpt-4o"]
```
